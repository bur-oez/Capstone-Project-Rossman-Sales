# Capstone-Project-Rossman-Sales

This project is a combination of EDA and time-series analysis of the Rossmann sales prediction challenge from kaggle.com [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

The data provided by the challenge consists of historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set.


Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

Our predicition result was evaluated on the Root Mean Square Percentage Error 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝑃𝐸. The RMSPE is calculated as:

where y_i denotes the sales of a single store on a single day and yhat_i denotes the corresponding prediction.

This way, our model could be compared to the other challenger's models.
